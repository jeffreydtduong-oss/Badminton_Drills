This app is only compatible with Android phones/tablets.

Below are the features of this app:
- User initiates the training by pressing the "Start" button. User can end the training any time by pressing the "Stop" button
- After 5 seconds, it will randomly flash a number for a set amount of time (this represents the part of the court). The range of numbers it can flash, as well as how long it stays on the screen can be configured in the Settings menu. Once the number flashes user should perform a split step
- There will be a first timer called "Time to shuttle", and it will deplete. The time can be adjusted in the Settings menu. This represents the amount of time you have to hit the shuttle after your split step
- Next there will be a second timer called "Time back to center", and it will deplete. The time can be adjusted in the Settings menu. This represents the amount of time you have to return to the center
- For both timers, in the Settings Menu, the user can set a Min and Max time value. If a range is specified, the app will randomize the times between the respective ranges. If user doesn't want random times, simply set Min = Max for time
- Once the second timer depletes, the process repeats and a random number will flash again. The expectation is that the user will have returned to the center at this time, and split step once they see the flashd number
- After one rep, this gets counted and incremented in the Rep Counter at the bottom. The user can choose to have the training terminate after a set number of reps are completed in the Settings menu (or just have it run continuously until they hit the "Stop" button)
- Additionally, the app will play out the sounds at each stage. If the user doesn't want that they can turn off the Sound Toggle at the top
- Added a new mode that lets you select another drill type. The other drill option right now incorporates shot selection, and only applies to a court with 4 sections
